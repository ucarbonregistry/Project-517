The proposed project titled under UCR is “2 MW small scale wind power by M/s Sustainable
Spinning and Commodities Private Limited.”, which is a Wind Power project located in Sukavada
Village, Amreli district in the state of Gujarat (India). The project is an operational activity with
continuous reduction of GHG, currently being applied under “Universal Carbon Registry” (UCR).

The geographic coordinates of the project locations are

Latitude: 21°56'20.6"N 

Longitude: 71°16'05.6"E

The project activity is a renewable power generation activity which incorporates installation and
operation of Single Wind Turbine Generator (WTG) having capacity of 2 MW manufactured and
supplied by Inox Wind Ltd in the district Amreli of the state of Gujarat in India. This project has been
promoted by M/s Sustainable Spinning and Commodities Private Limited.
The WTG under the project activity was commissioned on 10/06/2022 by Gujarat Energy
Development Agency (GEDA), Government of Gujarat, India.

As per the ex-ante estimate, the project will generate approximately 4380 MWh of electricity per
annum. The net generated electricity from the project activity is used for captive consumption by the
project proponent (PP). Wheeling Agreement is signed between Paschim Gujarat Vij Company
Limited (PGVCL) and PP. The project activity would be displacing equivalent quantum of grid
electricity resulting in emission reduction of 3942 tCO2e per annum. The project activity has been
helping in greenhouse gas (GHG) emission reduction by using renewable resources (wind energy) for
generating power which otherwise would have been generated using grid mix power plants, which is
dominated by fossil fuel based thermal powerplants.

The estimated annual average and the total CO2e emission reduction by the project activity is expected
to be 3942 tCO2e, whereas actual emission reduction achieved during the first CoU period shall be
submitted as a part of first monitoring and verification. Since the project activity generates electricity
through wind energy, a clean renewable energy source it will not cause any negative impact on the
environment and thereby contributes to climate change mitigation efforts.
